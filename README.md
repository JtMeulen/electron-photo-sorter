# Electron Photo Sorter

## Introduction
This is an Electron-based application designed to help users sort their photos with ease. It provides a user-friendly interface and powerful sorting options to make photo organization a breeze.

## How it works
The application uses ElectronJS, a framework for creating native applications with web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It takes advantage of Electron's multi-platform support to provide a consistent user experience across different operating systems.

When launched, the application presents the user with an interface to select their photo directory. Once a directory is selected, it will sort the photos by date and places the photos in sub folders with the related day.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/JtMeulen/electron-photo-sorter.git`
